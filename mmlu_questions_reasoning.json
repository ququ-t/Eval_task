        "reasoning": [
          "Okay, so I need to find the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q. Hmm, let me start by recalling some concepts from field theory. The degree of a field extension [K:Q] is the dimension of K as a vector space over Q. When dealing with multiple extensions, like Q(a, b, c), the degree can often be found by multiplying the degrees of successive simple extensions, provided each new extension is indeed an extension of the previous fields. But I need to be careful here because some of these square roots might be generating the same field, which would mean the degrees don't multiply.",
          "First, let's note that sqrt(18) simplifies to sqrt(9*2) which is 3*sqrt(2). So sqrt(18) is actually 3 times sqrt(2), which is already in Q(sqrt(2)) because Q(sqrt(2)) includes all scalar multiples of sqrt(2) with coefficients in Q. Therefore, Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(18)) is the same as Q(sqrt(2)). That means adding sqrt(18) doesn't actually add anything new. So the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is just Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).",
          "Now I need to find [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q]. I remember that when you adjoin two square roots, the degree is the product of the individual degrees if the square roots are independent. So first, adjoin sqrt(2) to Q. The minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x\u00b2 - 2, which is irreducible by Eisenstein with p=2. So [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] = 2.",
          "Next, adjoin sqrt(3) to Q(sqrt(2)). Now I need to check if sqrt(3) is in Q(sqrt(2)). If not, then the minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)) is still x\u00b2 - 3, so the degree would be another 2. Let me verify. Suppose sqrt(3) = a + b*sqrt(2) where a, b are in Q. Squaring both sides: 3 = a\u00b2 + 2b\u00b2 + 2ab*sqrt(2). Since sqrt(2) is irrational, the coefficient 2ab must be zero. So either a=0 or b=0. If a=0, then 3 = 2b\u00b2 => b\u00b2 = 3/2 => b = sqrt(3/2), which is irrational. If b=0, then 3 = a\u00b2, which would make a = sqrt(3), also irrational. Hence, sqrt(3) is not in Q(sqrt(2)), so [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] = 2. Therefore, the total degree is 2*2=4.",
          "Wait, but the original problem had sqrt(18) as well, but since that's redundant, the total degree should be 4. Let me check again. Maybe there's something I'm missing. For example, sometimes when you have multiple extensions, you have to check if adding another element affects the degree. But in this case, since sqrt(18) is already in Q(sqrt(2)), adding it doesn't change the field. So Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is the same as Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), which has degree 4 over Q. So the answer should be 4. But just to make sure, let me think again.",
          "Alternatively, maybe I should compute the degree using the tower law step by step. Let's write the tower as Q \u2286 Q(sqrt(2)) \u2286 Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) \u2286 Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)). But since sqrt(18) is in Q(sqrt(2)), the last extension is trivial. So the total degree is [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] = [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] * [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] = 2*2=4. Yeah, that seems right. Therefore, the degree is 4.The field extension \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{18}) \\) simplifies because \\( \\sqrt{18} = 3\\sqrt{2} \\), which is already in \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}) \\). Thus, the extension reduces to \\( \\mathbb{Q}(\\sqrt{2}, \\sqrt{3}) \\).",

The cycle (1,2,5,4) sends 2 to 5, 5 to 4, 4 to 1, and 1 to 2. So 3 is fixed by the second cycle. Therefore, after the transposition (2,3) sends 2 to 3, the second cycle leaves 3 alone.

So if G is a non-Abelian group and N is a normal subgroup, then the quotient group G/N is formed. The question is, does G being non-Abelian necessarily make G/N non-Abelian?",

For example, take the symmetric group S3, which is non-Abelian. If we take the normal subgroup A3 (the alternating group), then S3/A3 is isomorphic to Z2, which is Abelian. So in this case, the factor group is Abelian even though the original group isn't. Therefore, Statement 1 is false.",

          "Take G = S4 (the symmetric group on 4 elements). Let H be the Klein four-group, which is normal in S4 (since it's a union of conjugacy classes). Now, consider K as a subgroup of H of order 2. Since H is Abelian, all its subgroups are normal in H. But is K normal in G? If K is one of the cyclic subgroups of order 2 in H, then in S4, these elements might not be conjugate only within H. Wait, but in S4, the conjugacy class of a transposition is larger than the subgroup K. So if K is generated by a transposition, then its conjugates in G would include other transpositions, which might not be in K. But wait, H contains the products of two disjoint transpositions, like (12)(34), (13)(24), etc. So the elements of H are not transpositions. So maybe K is a subgroup like \u27e8(12)(34)\u27e9. Then, since H is normal in G, and K is a subgroup of H, does conjugating K by an element of G stay within K? Let's see: Take an element g in G and k in K. Then gkg\u207b\u00b9 would be in H (since H is normal in G). But since H is Abelian, all its subgroups are normal in H. But does that make K normal in G? Wait, take G = S4, H = {e, (12)(34), (13)(24), (14)(23)}, which is normal. Let K be {e, (12)(34)}. Is K normal in G? Let's conjugate (12)(34) by some element of G, say by (123). Then (123)(12)(34)(123)^-1. Let's compute (123)^-1 is (132). So (123)(12)(34)(132). First, compute (123)(12) = (13)(2), then (13)(34) = (134), then (134)(132) = (14). Wait, maybe my computation is off. Alternatively, conjugation by (123) on (12)(34): Apply the permutation (123) to the elements in the cycle (12)(34). So (1\u21922, 2\u21923, 3\u21921). Applying this to (12)(34) gives (23)(41) which is (23)(14). But (14)(23) is another element in H. If K is {e, (12)(34)}, then conjugating (12)(34) by (123) gives (14)(23), which is not in K. Therefore, K is not normal in G. So even though K is normal in H and H is normal in G, K isn't normal in G. Hence, Statement 2 is false.Step 1: Analyze Statement 1.
